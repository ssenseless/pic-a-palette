# pic-a-palette

Simply enough, if you have php installed as a dependency and can run php -S localhost:8000 from a powershell terminal, then you should be able to run our code.
You will also need to have a mysql server running on port 3306.
I've put the databases/schema needed to run it in this folder also, the .sql file.

In short,
- cd into pic-a-palette/pic-a-palette, run php -S localhost:8000
- Make sure you have our mysql schemas running on :3306
- Navigate to http://localhost:8000/www/home/index.html and enjoy.
