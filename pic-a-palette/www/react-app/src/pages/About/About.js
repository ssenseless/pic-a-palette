                    Pic-A-Palette is a fresh take on color palette generation that aids 
                    everyone - from artists to people interested in redesigning their homes - in 
                    getting the inspiration they need to strategize and finish their current project.

                    allowing organic color combinations to be derived by our AI. which will represent the colors

                      user selecting a variety of pictures and afterwards the color palette would be generated
